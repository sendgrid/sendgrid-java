 * The Twilio SendGrid Statistics API allows you to retrieve the various statistics related to your email program.  Tracking your emails is an important part of being a good sender and learning about how your users interact with your email. This includes everything from clicks and opens to looking at which browsers and mailbox providers your customers use.  SendGrid has broken up statistics in specific ways so that you can get at-a-glance data, as well as the details of how your email is being used.  Category statistics are available for the previous thirteen months only.  See [**Statistics Overview**](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/analytics-and-reporting/stats-overview) for more information.
