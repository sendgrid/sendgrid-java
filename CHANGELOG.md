- `response.statusCode` is now `response.getStatusCode()`
- `response.body` is now `response.getBody()`
- `response.headers` is now `response.getHeaders()`
- Adding a query parameter goes from:

```java
Map<String,String> queryParams = new HashMap<String, String>();
request.addQueryParam("limit", "1");
queryParams.put("limit", "1");
request.queryParams = queryParams;
```

to:

```java
request.addQueryParam("limit", "1");
```
