 * Twilio SendGrid Scheduled Sends API
 * The Twilio SendGrid Scheduled Sends API allows you to cancel or pause the send of one or more emails using a batch ID.  A `batch_id` groups multiple scheduled mail send requests together with the same ID. You can cancel or pause all of the requests associated with a batch ID up to 10 minutes before the scheduled send time.  See [**Canceling a Scheduled Send**](https://docs.sendgrid.com/for-developers/sending-email/stopping-a-scheduled-send) for a guide on creating a `batch_id`, assigning it to a scheduled send, and modifying the send.  See the Mail API's batching operations to validate a `batch_id` and retrieve all scheduled sends as an array.  When a batch is canceled, all messages associated with that batch will stay in your sending queue. When their `send_at` value is reached, they will be discarded.  When a batch is paused, all messages associated with that batch will stay in your sending queue, even after their `send_at` value has passed. This means you can remove a pause status, and your scheduled send will be delivered once the pause is removed. Any messages left with a pause status that are more than 72 hours old will be discarded as Expired.
