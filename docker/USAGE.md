# Info

This Docker image contains
 - `sendgrid-java`
 - Stoplight's Prism, which lets you try out the API without actually sending email

Run it in interactive mode with `-it`.

You can mount repositories in the `/mnt/sendgrid-java` and `/mnt/java-http-client` directories to use them instead of the default Twilio SendGrid libraries. Read on for more info.
